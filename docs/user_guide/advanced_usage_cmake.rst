.. note::

    Some command tools:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Get device's soc info.
        adb shell getprop | grep platform

        # command for generating sha256_sum
        sha256sum /path/to/your/file



Advanced usage
--------------

There are three common advanced use cases:
  - run your model on the embedded device(ARM LINUX)
  - converting model to C++ code.
  - tuning GPU kernels for a specific SoC.

Run you model on the embedded device(ARM Linux)
-----------------------------------------------

The way to run your model on the ARM Linux is nearly same as with android, except you need specify a device config file.

  .. code-block:: bash

    python tools/python/run_model.py --config ../mace-models/mobilenet-v1/mobilenet-v1.yml --validate --device_yml=/path/to/devices.yml

There are two steps to do before run:

1. configure login without password

    MACE use ssh to connect embedded device, you should copy your public key to embedded device with the blow command.

    .. code-block:: bash

      cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -q {user}@{ip} "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

2. write your own device yaml configuration file.

    * **Example**

        Here is an device yaml config demo.

        .. literalinclude:: devices/demo_device_nanopi.yml
            :language: yaml

    * **Configuration**
        The detailed explanation is listed in the blow table.

        .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1

            * - Options
              - Usage
            * - target_abis
              - Device supported abis, you can get it via ``dpkg --print-architecture`` and
                ``dpkg --print-foreign-architectures`` command, if more than one abi is supported,
                separate them by commas.
            * - target_socs
              - device soc, you can get it from device manual, we haven't found a way to get it in shell.
            * - models
              - device models full name, you can get via get ``lshw`` command (third party package, install it via your package manager).
                see it's product value.
            * - address
              - Since we use ssh to connect device, ip address is required.
            * - username
              - login username, required.


Model Protection
--------------------------------

Model can be encrypted by obfuscation.

    .. code-block:: bash

        python tools/python/encrypt.py --config ../mace-models/mobilenet-v1/mobilenet-v1.yml

It will override ``mobilenet_v1.pb`` and ``mobilenet_v1.data``. 
If you want to compiled the model into a library, you should use options ``--gencode_model --gencode_param`` to generate model code, i.e.,

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        python tools/python/encrypt.py --config ../mace-models/mobilenet-v1/mobilenet-v1.yml --gencode_model --gencode_param

It will generate model code into ``mace/codegen/models`` and also generate a helper function ``CreateMaceEngineFromCode`` in ``mace/codegen/engine/mace_engine_factory.h`` by which you can create an engine with models built in it.

After that you can rebuild the engine. 
    
    .. code-block:: bash

        RUNTIME=GPU RUNMODE=code QUANTIZE=OFF RPCMEM=OFF bash tools/cmake/cmake-build-armeabi-v7a.sh

``RUNMODE=code`` means you compile and link model library with MACE engine.

When you test the model in code format, you should specify it in the script as follows.
    
    .. code-block:: bash

        python tools/python/run_model.py --config ../mace-models/mobilenet-v1/mobilenet-v1.yml --gencode_model --gencode_param

Of course you can generate model code only, and use parameter file.

When you need to integrate the libraries into your applications, you can link `libmace_static.a` and `libmodel.a` to your target. These are under the directory:
``build/cmake-build/armeabi-v7a/install/lib/``, the header files you need are under ``build/cmake-build/armeabi-v7a/install/include``.

Refer to \ ``mace/tools/mace_run.cc``\ for full usage. The following list the key steps.

    .. code-block:: cpp

        // Include the headers
        #include "mace/public/mace.h"
        // If the model_graph_format is code
        #include "mace/public/${model_name}.h"
        #include "mace/public/mace_engine_factory.h"

        // ... Same with the code in basic usage

        // 4. Create MaceEngine instance
        std::shared_ptr<mace::MaceEngine> engine;
        MaceStatus create_engine_status;
        // Create Engine from compiled code
        create_engine_status =
            CreateMaceEngineFromCode(model_name.c_str(),
                                     model_data_ptr, // nullptr if model_data_format is code
                                     model_data_size, // 0 if model_data_format is code
                                     input_names,
                                     output_names,
                                     device_type,
                                     &engine);
        if (create_engine_status != MaceStatus::MACE_SUCCESS) {
          // Report error or fallback
        }
 
        // ... Same with the code in basic usage


Transform models after conversion
---------------------------------

If ``model_graph_format`` or ``model_data_format`` is specified as `file`, the model or weight file will
be generated as a `.pb` or `.data` file after model conversion. After that, more transformations can be
applied to the generated files, such as compression or encryption. To achieve that, the model loading is
split to two stages: 1) load the file from file system to memory buffer; 2) create the MACE engine from the
model buffer. So between the two stages, transformations can be inserted to decompress or decrypt the model
buffer. The transformations are user defined. The following lists the key steps when both ``model_graph_format``
and ``model_data_format`` are set as `file`.

    .. code-block:: cpp

        // Load model graph from file system
        std::unique_ptr<mace::port::ReadOnlyMemoryRegion> model_graph_data =
            make_unique<mace::port::ReadOnlyBufferMemoryRegion>();
        if (FLAGS_model_file != "") {
          auto fs = GetFileSystem();
          status = fs->NewReadOnlyMemoryRegionFromFile(FLAGS_model_file.c_str(),
              &model_graph_data);
          if (status != MaceStatus::MACE_SUCCESS) {
            // Report error or fallback
          }
        }
        // Load model data from file system
        std::unique_ptr<mace::port::ReadOnlyMemoryRegion> model_weights_data =
            make_unique<mace::port::ReadOnlyBufferMemoryRegion>();
        if (FLAGS_model_data_file != "") {
          auto fs = GetFileSystem();
          status = fs->NewReadOnlyMemoryRegionFromFile(FLAGS_model_data_file.c_str(),
              &model_weights_data);
          if (status != MaceStatus::MACE_SUCCESS) {
            // Report error or fallback
          }
        }
        if (model_graph_data == nullptr || model_weights_data == nullptr) {
          // Report error or fallback
        }

        std::vector<unsigned char> transformed_model_graph_data;
        std::vector<unsigned char> transformed_model_weights_data;
        // Add transformations here.
        ...
        // Release original model data after transformations
        model_graph_data.reset();
        model_weights_data.reset();

        // Create the MACE engine from the model buffer
        std::shared_ptr<mace::MaceEngine> engine;
        MaceStatus create_engine_status;
        create_engine_status =
            CreateMaceEngineFromProto(transformed_model_graph_data.data(),
                                      transformed_model_graph_data.size(),
                                      transformed_model_weights_data.data(),
                                      transformed_model_weights_data.size(),
                                      input_names,
                                      output_names,
                                      config,
                                      &engine);
        if (create_engine_status != MaceStatus::MACE_SUCCESS) {
          // Report error or fallback
        }


Tuning for specific SoC's GPU
---------------------------------

If you want to use the GPU of a specific device, you can tune the performance for particular devices, which may get 1~10% performance improvement.

You can specify `--tune` option when you want to run and tune the performance at the same time.

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        python tools/python/run_model.py --config ../mace-models/mobilenet-v1/mobilenet-v1.yml --tune

It will generate OpenCL tuned parameter binary file in `build/mobilenet_v1/opencl` directory.
    
    .. code-block:: none

        └── mobilenet_v1_tuned_opencl_parameter.MIX2S.sdm845.bin

It specifies your test platform model and SoC. You can use it in production to reduce latency on GPU.

To deploy it, change the names of files generated above for not collision and push them to **your own device's directory**.
Use like the previous procedure, below lists the key steps differently.

    .. code-block:: cpp

        // Include the headers
        #include "mace/public/mace.h"
        // 0. Declare the device type (must be same with ``runtime`` in configuration file)
        DeviceType device_type = DeviceType::GPU;

        // 1. configuration
        MaceStatus status;
        MaceEngineConfig config(device_type);
        std::shared_ptr<GPUContext> gpu_context;

        const std::string storage_path ="path/to/storage";
        gpu_context = GPUContextBuilder()
            .SetStoragePath(storage_path)
            .SetOpenCLBinaryPaths(path/to/opencl_binary_paths)
            .SetOpenCLParameterPath(path/to/opencl_parameter_file)
            .Finalize();
        config.SetGPUContext(gpu_context);
        config.SetGPUHints(
            static_cast<GPUPerfHint>(GPUPerfHint::PERF_NORMAL),
            static_cast<GPUPriorityHint>(GPUPriorityHint::PRIORITY_LOW));

        // ... Same with the code in basic usage.


Multi Model Support (optional)
--------------------------------

If multiple models are configured in config file. After you test it, it will generate more than one tuned parameter files.
Then you need to merge them together.

    .. code-block:: bash

        python tools/python/gen_opencl.py

After that, it will generate one set of files into `build/opencl` directory.

    .. code-block:: none

        ├── compiled_opencl_kernel.bin
        └── tuned_opencl_parameter.bin


You can also generate code into the engine by specify ``--gencode``, after which you should rebuild the engine.


Validate accuracy of MACE model
-------------------------------

MACE supports **python validation script** as a plugin to test the accuracy, the plugin script could be used for below two purpose.

1. Test the **accuracy(like Top-1)** of MACE model(specifically quantization model) converted from other framework(like tensorflow)
2. Show some real output if you want to see it.

The script define some interfaces like `preprocess` and `postprocess` to deal with input/outut and calculate the accuracy,
you could refer to the `sample code <https://github.com/XiaoMi/mace/tree/master/tools/accuracy_validator.py>`__ for detail.
the sample code show how to calculate the Top-1 accuracy with imagenet validation dataset.


Reduce Library Size
-------------------

Remove the registration of the ops and delegators unused for your models in the
``mace/ops/registry/ops_registry.cc`` and ``mace/ops/registry/op_delegators_registry.cc``,
which will reduce the library size significantly. the final binary just link the registered ops and delegators' code.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include "mace/ops/registry/registry.h"

    namespace mace {
    namespace ops {
    // Just leave the ops used in your models

    ...

    }  // namespace ops


    void RegisterAllOps(OpRegistry *registry) {
    // Just leave the ops used in your models

      ...

      ops::RegisterMyCustomOp(registry);

      ...

    }

    }  // namespace mace

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include "mace/ops/registry/registry.h"

    namespace mace {
    namespace ops {
    // Just leave the delegators used in your ops

    ...

    }  // namespace ops


    void RegisterAllOpDelegators(OpDelegatorRegistry *registry) {
    // Just leave the delegators used in your ops

      ...

      ops::RegisterMyCustomDelegator(registry);

      ...

    }

    }  // namespace mace

Reduce Model Size
-------------------
Model file size can be a bottleneck for the deployment of neural networks on mobile devices,
so MACE provides several ways to reduce the model size with no or little performance or accuracy degradation.

**1. Save model weights in half-precision floating point format**

The data type of a regular model is float (32bit). To reduce the model weights size,
half (16bit) can be used to reduce it by half with negligible accuracy degradation.
Therefore, the default storage type for a regular model in MACE is half. However,
if the model is very sensitive to accuracy, storage type can be changed to float.

In the deployment file, ``data_type`` is ``fp16_fp32`` by default and can be changed to ``fp32_fp32``,
for CPU it can also be changed to ``bf16_fp32`` and ``fp16_fp16``(``fp16_fp16`` can only be used on armv8.2 or higher version).

For CPU, ``fp16_fp32`` means that the weights are saved in half and actual inference is in float,
while ``bf16_fp32`` means that the weights are saved in bfloat16 and actual inference is in float,
and ``fp16_fp16`` means that the weights are saved in half and actual inference is in half.


For GPU, ``fp16_fp32`` means that the ops in GPU take half as inputs and outputs while kernel execution in float.

**2. Save model weights in quantized fixed point format**

Weights of convolutional (excluding depthwise) and fully connected layers take up a major part of model size.
These weights can be quantized to 8bit to reduce the size to a quarter, whereas the accuracy usually decreases only by 1%-3%.
For example, the top-1 accuracy of MobileNetV1 after quantization of weights is 68.2% on the ImageNet validation set.
``quantize_large_weights`` can be specified as 1 in the deployment file to save these weights in 8bit and actual inference in float.
It can be used for both CPU and GPU.
